# Claude Code Obsidian Integration

Integrate [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) AI coding agent into your Obsidian vault.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a third-party community plugin and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially supported by Obsidian. This plugin is independently developed and maintained.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Coding Assistant**: Access Claude Code directly within Obsidian for intelligent code suggestions, explanations, and debugging help
- **Seamless Integration**: Works naturally within your Obsidian workflow without switching between applications
- **React-based UI**: Modern, responsive interface built with React for smooth user experience

## Security & Privacy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin requires specific permissions to function properly:

### File System Access
This plugin launches and communicates with Claude Code, which requires access to files outside of your Obsidian vault. This is necessary because:

- Claude Code needs to read and write code files in your development projects
- The AI assistant requires context from your codebase to provide accurate suggestions
- File operations (create, edit, delete) are performed based on your instructions to Claude Code

### Local MCP Server
This plugin starts a local Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to:

- **Manage permissions**: Intercept and control file access requests from Claude Code
- **Provide security**: Allow you to approve or deny each file operation before it executes
- **Ensure transparency**: Show you exactly what Claude Code is trying to access

Write, delete, and other call tool operations require your explicit approval through the permission dialog, giving you control over what Claude Code can modify.

> [!CAUTION]
> Claude Code may perform destructive operations. Please follow best practices such as maintaining backups and utilizing [Claude Code Hooks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks).

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin requires the official Claude Code to be installed separately. The plugin acts as an integration layer between Obsidian and Claude Code.
